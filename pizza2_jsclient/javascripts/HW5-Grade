Schema does not create tables(-5).

Problem 1:
Why are you asking for a price? I am not sure what in that problem prompts you
for that. Also, regardless of what I enter into these prompts I always get an
error so I am not sure if this is even compiling correctly(-5). I also cannot
run any of my tests(-10).

Problem 2:
Not sure what you are doing here but I always get errors and the program
crashes. Therefore, not sure if it is compliling correctly(-5). I also cannot
run any of my tests(-10).

Problem 3:
I only ever get errors when running this so I am not sure if the code is
compiling(-5). I also cannot run any of my tests(-10).
